# Lab 02 - Scaled Ingredients

_Learning Objective: demonstrate an understanding of data manipulation, input, and formatted output_

Sometimes a recipe makes a lot more or a lot less than what you really need. For this lab you will be making a program that will ask the user for the number of servings they want to make then calculate the amount of each ingredient needed.

## Instructions

**Step 1:** Find a recipe you want to use for this lab. It can be a family recipe, one on the back of a box in your pantry, or something you found online. It should have at least 4 ingredients. In the documentation at the top of the lab tell me why you chose your recipe and what the original number of servings is (look for something like "makes 12").

**Step 2:** Make a variable that stores the user's desired number of servings. Be sure to type cast their input to be an int type.

**Step 3:** Make a variable that stores the ratio of desired servings divided by original servings. This is your scale factor for each of the ingredients.

**Step 4:** Output the recipe with the **scaled amount for each ingredient** followed by the **directions**. To make it look neat, output only two decimal places for each amount and put each ingredient on its own line.
